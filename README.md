# Project Overview

For this project, you will propose, design, and implement a project of your own
design. To receive a score of **Proficient** in the Computational Thinking
category this project must meet all of the requirements to receive 6 points as
an AP Computer Science Principles project submission.

## Part 1: Write a Proposal

First, you will propose a project and create a design document to help you think
through all of the components that you will need to implement. It is very easy
to over scope and start working on a project that is too large to finish. I
recommend starting small, maybe implement a portion of a bigger project and
then, if there is extra time, add more onto it.

### Example Proposals

* Wordle, a word guessing game: [LINK](Examples/Wordle.md)
* High Score Tracker: [LINK](Examples/HighScoreTracker.md)
* Random Name Generator: [LINK](Examples/Random%20Name%20Generator.md)
* Personality Quiz: [LINK](Examples/PersonalityQuiz.md)

### Proficient Requirements

To help you meet the proficient requirement, I've provided a list of additional
requirements that, if done properly should get you very close to a full 6
points.

Your project should meet all of these requirements:

1. Uses a list to store an arbitrary number of elements
2. Accepts user input
3. Has at least one function that:
    * Requires at least 1 parameter
    * Validates the input
    * Throws an exception if the input is not valid
    * Contains a loop that iterates (no `while(false)` loops)
    * Is a significant part of your overall program
4. Iterates over the list from #1. This can be done in your function for #3.
    * Alternatively, you can randomly select items from the list 

### Advanced Requirements

In your proposal, you must come up with one or more advanced features for
approval. The aim of these features should be to learn something new and
challenge yourself to learn and grow.

### Proposal Format

Your proposal will have 3 main sections: Overview, High Level Flowchart, and
Methods. Below you will find an overview of each section:

#### Overview <!-- omit in toc --> 

Write 3 - 5 sentences explaining your programs purpose and describing the user's
inputs and program's outputs. This will become a guide for the first section of
your written response.

#### High Level Flowchart <!-- omit in toc --> 

Think about what your program must do to accomplish its goal. Draw a high level
flowchart of the entire process from start to finish. In this flowchart, you may
gloss over hard to implement details that you're not sure how to write. This
flowchart should be a high level overview showing how the program transitions
from one part of your program to the next. This will start as a draft and you
will likely make revisions throughout the project to match any changes you make
during implementation.

#### Functions <!-- omit in toc --> 

After you have a high level flowchart of your project, find the complex sections
and break these out to create sub flowcharts. These will be your functions. You
should get as detailed as possible in each of these flowcharts breaking down the
process to the simplest commands. If you find the flowchart becoming complex,
consider breaking it into two or more sub flowcharts that are used to complete
the goal.

For each function flowchart, come up with a function header and a comment. Use
the following questions as a guide:

1. What data do I need to pass to this function?
2. What are valid inputs?
3. What does the function accomplish?
4. What (if any) does this function return (produce)?
5. At a high level, what does this function do?
6. Based on #5, what is a short name I can give this function?

Finally, in English, write a step-by-step detailed explanation describing how
this function will be implemented.

## Part 2: Implement the project (~2 weeks)

You will receive 4 to 5 patterns of in class time to work on this project (about 
5 hours). This will almost certainly not be enough time to complete the entire 
project without coming prepared to class with questions / specific goals for 
progress. The expectation is that during this project, you are spending at least 
3 hours of time outside of class each week on your project.

For your personal project, you should follow this function creation guide:

## Part 3: Written Response

After you have finished your project. You will complete a written response which
matches the format of an AP Project submission. This includes recording a short,
less than 1 minute, video. The response template can be found here:

## Project Ideas

If you're having trouble coming up with a project idea, you can use any of the
following project ideas. **Note**: Each of the projects could range greatly in
difficulty depending on how it is implemented. However, an attempt to sort them
into difficulty categories was made. You should however take this with a grain
of salt as a Level 1 project could easily become a Level 3+ project without
properly scoping the project. Be sure to talk it through with Mr. DeMonico to get a
solid idea of how to meet the proficient requirements.

### Level 1 <!-- omit in toc -->
